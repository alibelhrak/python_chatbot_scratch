🗣️#AI Chatbot with CNN - Built from Scratch🤖

This project is a Conversational AI Chatbot built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras. Instead of traditional NLP techniques, it uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Sequential model to classify intents and generate responses.

🛠️ Technologies Used

TensorFlow & Keras 🏗️

Sequential CNN Model 🧠

NLP Preprocessing 📝

JSON-based Intents 📂


🚀 Features

✅ Understands user queries based on trained intents
✅ Uses CNN for text classification instead of traditional NLP models
✅ Fully built from scratch for a deep understanding of chatbot development
✅ Easily extendable with new intents and responses

📌 How It Works

1️⃣ Preprocess text data (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
2️⃣ Train a CNN model on categorized intents
3️⃣ Use the trained model to predict user intent
4️⃣ Generate an appropriate response

📌 Next Steps: Improve response generation by integrating an RNN or Transformer-based model for more natural conversations!
